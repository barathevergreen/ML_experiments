### Kaggle data set - https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

#### Attribute and multivariate statistics of diverse features and Machine learning model & Best model comparison and experimentation: 

- __KNN:__ Exploring Best K value identification
- __SVM:__ Comparison of different kernels for understanding
- __Decision Tree Classifier:__ Decision tree maximum performance based on number of features
- __Random forest classifier:__ Classification behavior based on different number of estimators

Concluded KNN model with certain parameters well suited for use case and pickle dum :)
